# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts the sale prices of houses based on key features like square footage and number of rooms.  
It's part of my internship tasks at **@Indolike** to showcase basic regression modeling with real-world housing data.

## 📌 Description
We use the Kaggle House Prices dataset to build a simple **Linear Regression** model.  
The model is trained on three key numerical features:
- Above ground living area (`GrLivArea`)
- Number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)
- Number of full bathrooms (`FullBath`)

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Performance
The model predicts house prices with a reasonable level of accuracy using basic linear regression and minimal preprocessing.

## 📁 Dataset
